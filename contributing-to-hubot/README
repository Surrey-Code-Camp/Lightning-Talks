example.js is the example code that we wrote during the workshop. The slides aren't included because they provide
no benefit as they were simply introductory.

To get this script working in hubot, copy example.js to the scripts/ directory in your forked
surreycodecamp-hubot repo. Copy it, hack on it, make whatever changes you want and add some documentation. First
person to make the changes and throw up a PR will have it merged and deployed to the working hubot instance (ponch)!
